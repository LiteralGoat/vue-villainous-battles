# Vue Villainous Battles - ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è vs ü¶∏
A quick Vue.js practice project that got out of hand. 

## Starting template
The starting template was from the Udemy course [Vue.js by Maximillian at Academind](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

## Solving the challenge
The challenge was to create a "Monster" game where the player fights the monster. Initially none of the functions were implemented, hence the challenge. I finished the challenge and then started to add some twists. The idea was to try out different concepts and see the boundaries of Vue DOM manipulation, especially with data binding. When adding my own flair with [Vanta HALO](https://www.vantajs.com/?effect=halo#(amplitudeFactor:3,backgroundAlpha:1,backgroundColor:7606733,baseColor:13762815,color2:15918901,gyroControls:!f,minHeight:200,minWidth:200,mouseControls:!t,mouseEase:!t,ringFactor:1,rotationFactor:1,scale:1,scaleMobile:1,size:0.9,speed:1,touchControls:!t,xOffset:0,yOffset:0.22)) I also changed the name to Vue Villains Battleground and thus also utilizing the data from the NPM package [supervillains](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supervillains) by Sindre Sorhus. The rest of the features are menu alternatives and a name input.
